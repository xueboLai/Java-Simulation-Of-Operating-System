Lab 3:

It is very easy to compile this program.
Please follow the instructions below:

First, we need to compile the source code. To do that, please use "cd" command
to get into the folder called src.
command: cd src

Then, compile the Main Class which is in ResourceAllocation.java (Other java source files also need to be in the folder).
command: javac ResourceAllocation.java

After the source files have been compiled, now we can supply the name of the class, which the main method is in, and with file name:
command: java ResourceAllocation [Please enter the relative/absolute path of your file]
For example:
java ResourceAllocation testing.txt

The result will be printed to console (terminal).
