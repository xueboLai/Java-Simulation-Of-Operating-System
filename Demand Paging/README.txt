Lab 4:

It is very easy to compile this program.
Please follow the instructions below:

First, we need to compile the source code. To do that, please use "cd" command
to get into the folder called src which is inside lab4.
command: cd src

Then, compile the Main Class which is in Paging.java (Other java source files also need to be in the folder).
command: javac Paging.java

After the source files have been compiled, now we can supply the 6 values needed by the program,
command: java Paging [the 6 values]
For example:
command: java Paging 20 10 10 2 10 lru


The result will be printed to console (terminal).
