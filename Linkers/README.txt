Homework1 Linkers:

It is very easy to compile this program.
Please follow the instructions below:

First, we need to compile the source code. To do that, please use "cd" command
to get into the folder called source_code.
command: cd source_code

Then, compile the Linker Class (Other java source files also need to be in the folder)
command: javac Linker.java

After the source files have been compiled, now we can supply the main method in Linker class with file name (type the file path after Linker):
command: java Linker [the relative or absolute path of your file]

The result will be printed to console (terminal).
