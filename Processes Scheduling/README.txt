Lab2 Scheduling:

It is very easy to compile this program.
Please follow the instructions below:

First, we need to compile the source code. To do that, please use "cd" command
to get into the folder called src
command: cd src

Then, compile the Scheduling Class (Other java source files also need to be in the same folder)
command: javac Scheduling.java

After the source files have been compiled, now we can supply the main method in Linker class with fileName or —-verbose filename (type the file path after Scheduling):

command: java Scheduling [the relative or absolute path of your file]
Or
Command: java Scheduling —-verbose [the relative or absolute path of your file]

The result will be printed to console (terminal).

Please note that test1.txt is supplied for testing.
